- The only thing i did is I have change the entire code. 
- This time you don't have to do anyting, just update and go.
- I hope the issues are fixed, if not please let my know.
- Let my know if it is better now, Thanks! 👊😉👍

## Fixes
- ✔️ Car is now locked for everyone, you have to onlock it with [L] button
- ✔️ I did this because you alse lock it with you [/park] or use [F5] and park your vehicle, it locks the vehcile.
- ✔️ i hope the flaoting is away, cause i don't have it on my end.

## Added 👊😉👍 5-2-2022
- ✔️ Config file is sorter, no Vip or Admin config anymore, everting works with the database now.
- ✔️ When you give a player a vip, you now also can give a max amount of parking vehicles that is allowed for each player.
- ✔️ Use: /park-addvid [id] [amount]

## 🥵 You have to update your database 
- 👇 Use this to update your player_parking_vips table.
```sql
ALTER TABLE `player_parking_vips` ADD `maxparking` int(5) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
ALTER TABLE `player_parking_vips` ADD `hasparked` int(5) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 
```

## ---------------------------------------------Updates------------------------------------------------

## You have to add a new Database Table to your database
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `player_parking_vips` (
  `id` int(10) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `citizenid` varchar(255) COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci NOT NULL,
  `citizenname` varchar(255) COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`) USING BTREE
) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=1 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_unicode_ci ROW_FORMAT=DYNAMIC;
```
## Added 👊😉👍 4-2-2022
- ✔️ You can now add/remove a player as vip by command.
- ✔️ A player can park right after you have add this player as vip.
- ✔️ If the player is not online, you have to remove it from the database (player_parking_vips) yourself.
- ✔️ Aslong this player don't unpart this vehicle the vehicle stays parked, untill the player unpark it.
- ✔️ When unparked the player is unable to park again and he must use the garage to store his vehicle.

## New commands
- /park-addvid [id] to add a online player as vip       (Admin Only)
- /park-removevip [id] to remove a online player ad vip (Admin Only)

## Extra info
- The id is not the citizenid but the ingame player id,
- so if this user had the id 2 you use the 2 as id to add this player as vip,
- the same for removeing this player, but this player has to be online or you have to remove it by hand from the database,
- 👉👉👉 DONT FOTGET TO ADD YOUR SELF AS VIP, or you can't park 😉👍
Enjoy 👊😉👍
