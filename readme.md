# 🔥 **MH-PARKING PRO** **(QB/QBX/ESX) by MaDHouSe79**
### **This is the best realistic park system you can find for fivem in 2025, PERIOD!**
### **When you own the vehicle and the engine is turned off, `Get out = Parked`. `Get in = Drive`. PERIOD.**
### **When you park and your engine is turned off, all players will automatically exit the vehicle.**
### **Supports a lot of Keyscripts and Frameworks like `ESX/QB/QBX` automaticly**
### **It's realistic and fun to have on your server, and your players will definitely love to use it.**
### **The best part is, all vehicles spawns are server side, and it uses stagebag and smart cache, what most scripts don't use.**
### **`MH-Parking` is the best choice you can make for your FiveM Server in 2025, PERIOD.** 
### **Many paid scripts don't work like `MH-Parking`, and `MH-Parking` will definitely outperform the most pro paid scripts, and the fun part is `MH-Parking` it is totaly free and open source 🤤**
### **Why is it open source? So people can see that I'm not stealing code and that I created it myself, and maby people can learn from it.**

# 📌 When is mh-parking useful?
- mh-parking is especially useful if you are running a roleplay or modded server where vehicles need to be managed realistically and persistently. 

# 📌 It is a good fit when:
- Vehicles should persist between server sessions, crashes, or restarts — they shouldn’t just disappear when players log out.
- Players can park vehicles in personal spaces, such as homes, garages, company areas, or private parking zones.
- You want realistic parking rules, such as:
- parking timers,
- impound behavior when rules aren’t followed,
- VIP parking limits or special permissions,
- admin-controlled parking locations.
- You want vehicle spawning and storage to work in a more advanced way, instead of the basic “take from garage / store in garage” system.
- Your server aims for a more immersive, real-life handling of player vehicles.
- If your server is small or you just need a very simple garage system, mh-parking might be more than you need.
- But for medium-to-large servers, especially serious RP communities, it can add a lot of structure and realism.
